> **Last updated: Jan 15, 2025**

Number Friends is a playful learning app for young children. We purposely collect as little information as possible and never share it with advertisers. This policy explains what is stored on the device, how subscription receipts are verified, and how you can contact us if you have questions.

## Information We Collect

- **Free‑play counter** – the app keeps an anonymous counter in the iOS Keychain so we know how many free sessions have been used. It never leaves the device.
- **Subscription receipts** – Apple provides encrypted receipts so we can check if a subscription is active. We never see credit‑card numbers or personal billing data.
- **Diagnostics (optional)** – if you opt into “Share with developers” in iOS settings, Apple may send anonymized crash logs that help us fix bugs.

## How the Data Is Used

1. Unlock premium content when StoreKit reports an active subscription.  
2. Determine whether a player still has free practice sessions.  
3. Improve stability when anonymized diagnostics are available.

## Storage & Sharing

- We do **not** run a separate backend for Number Friends; all gameplay data remains on the device.  
- Subscription receipts stay within Apple’s StoreKit APIs.  
- We do not sell or share data with ad networks, analytics SDKs, or third parties.

## Children’s Privacy

The app is designed for kids, but subscription and parent dashboards are behind soft gates. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children, and we encourage parents/guardians to review sessions periodically.

## Subscriptions & Billing

- Premium is an auto‑renewable subscription managed entirely by Apple.  
- Payment is charged to your Apple ID at confirmation and renews unless cancelled 24 hours before the period ends.  
- Manage or cancel anytime under **Settings → Apple ID → Subscriptions**.  
- Unused free trial time is forfeited after a subscription purchase.

## Your Choices

- Delete the app to remove cached content. The free‑play counter may remain because it is stored securely in Keychain.  
- You can disable diagnostics sharing via **Settings → Privacy & Security → Analytics & Improvements**.  
- For data inquiries or deletion requests, email **liupeng.skstore@gmail.com**.

## Updates to This Policy

We may occasionally update this page. The newest version will always be hosted at [https://liufsd.github.io/2025/01/NumberFriends-Privacy/](https://liufsd.github.io/2025/01/NumberFriends-Privacy/). Continued use of the app after changes means you accept the revised policy.
