Welcome to Number Friends! By downloading or using the app you agree to the following terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms, please delete the app and cancel any active subscriptions.

## License

You receive a non‑transferable license to install and use Number Friends on Apple‑branded devices that you own or control. Reverse engineering, redistribution, or using the content to build data sets without written permission is prohibited.

## Educational Use

Number Friends is designed for personal/family education. Classroom or commercial deployment requires prior consent. Screenshots or recordings should not remove branding or imply endorsement without permission.

## Subscriptions & Billing

- Premium access is sold as an auto‑renewable subscription through Apple.  
- Payment is charged to your Apple ID at confirmation and renews automatically unless cancelled at least 24 hours before the period ends.  
- Manage or cancel anytime in **Settings → Apple ID → Subscriptions**.  
- Unused free trial time is forfeited once a subscription is purchased.  
- Prices may change; Apple will notify you before renewal if that happens.

## Free Experience

The app offers a limited number of free practice sessions. The remaining count is stored locally; reinstalling may not restore additional attempts. Once the limit is reached, a subscription is required for continued use.

## Content & Updates

We may add, modify, or remove features without prior notice. Some updates might be required for continued access. Educational content is provided “as is,” and we do not warrant uninterrupted service.

## Termination

We reserve the right to suspend or terminate access if users violate these terms. You may terminate at any time by deleting the app and cancelling your subscription.

## Disclaimer & Liability

Number Friends is provided without warranties of any kind. To the maximum extent permitted by law, the developer is not liable for indirect, incidental, or consequential damages arising from the use of the app.
